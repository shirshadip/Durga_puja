        <p>Durga is an ancient goddess of Hinduism according to available archeological and textual evidence. However,
            the origins of Durga Puja are unclear and undocumented.


            The Dadhimati Mata Temple of Rajasthan preserves a Durga-related inscription from chapter 10 of Devi
            Mahatmya. The temple inscription has been dated by modern methods to 608 CE.[26][27]

            13th-14th century Durga statue from Ambari, Guwahati, Assam.
            The name Durga, and related terms, appear in Vedic literature, such as in the Rigveda hymns 4.28, 5.34,
            8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the Atharvaveda[28][29][E] A deity named Durgi
            appears in section 10.1.7 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka.[28] While the Vedic literature uses the word Durga,
            the description therein lacks legendary details about her or about Durga Puja that is found in later Hindu
            literature.[31]

                A key text associated with Durga Puja is Devi Mahatmya, which is recited during the festival. Durga was
                likely well established by the time this Hindu text was composed, the date of which scholars estimate as
                between 400 and 600 CE.[32][33][34] The Devi Mahatmya scripture describes the nature of evil forces
                symbolised by Mahishasura as shape-shifting, deceptive, and adapting in nature, in form and in strategy
                to
                create difficulties and thus achieve their evil ends. Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in
                order to achieve her solemn goals.[17][35][F]Durga, in her various forms, appears as an independent
                deity in
                the Indian texts.[37]

                In the Mahabharata, both Yudhisthira and Arjuna invoke hymns to Durga.[38] She appears in Harivamsa in
                the
                form of Vishnu's eulogy and in Pradyumna's prayer. The prominent mention of Durga in such epics may have
                led
                to her worship.[39][11][40]

                Maa Durga Rudra Roop at Gosani Jatra Puri
                Some versions of the Puranas mention Durga Puja to be a spring festival, while the Devi-Bhagavata Purana
                and
                two other Shakta Puranas mentions it to be an autumn festival. The Ramayana manuscripts are also
                inconsistent. Versions of Ramayana found in the north, west, and south of the Indian subcontinent
                describe
                Rama to be remembering Surya (the Hindu sun god) before his battle against Ravana, but the Bengali
                manuscripts of Ramayana, such as the Krittivasi Ramayana, a 15th-century manuscript by Krittivasa,
                mention
                Rama to be worshipping Durga.[41] As per the legend, Rama worshipped Durga in the autumn to have her
                blessings before defeating Ravana. While he was preparing for the worship of the goddess, Durga hid one
                of
                the 108 flowers of lotus, very essential for her worship. Having found only 107 of 108 lotuses at the
                time
                of the worship, Rama decided to offer one of his eyes in place of that lotus. When he was about to offer
                his
                eye, Durga appeared and told him that she had only hidden the flower in order to test his devotion and
                she
                was satisfied with it. She blessed Rama and he continued with her worship. Since the gods are believed
                to be
                sleeping during autumn, the awakening rite of the Durga puja is also known as akƒÅla bodhana.[42]

                Surviving manuscripts from the 14th-century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records
                suggest the royalty and wealthy families to be sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities, since at
                least the 16th-century.[43] The 11th or 12th-century Jain text Yasatilaka by Somadeva mentions an annual
                festival dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the
                description
                mirrors attributes of Durga Puja.[11][44]

                According to some scholars, the worship of the fierce warrior goddess Durga, and her darker and more
                violent
                manifestation Kali, became popular in the Bengal region during and after the medieval era, marked by
                Muslim
                invasions and conquests.[45]

                The significance of Durga and other goddesses in Hindu culture is stated to have increased after Islamic
                armies conquered regions of the Indian subcontinent.[46] According to yet other scholars, the
                marginalization of Bengali Hindus during the medieval era led to a reassertion of Hindu identity and an
                emphasis on Durga Puja as a social festival, publicly celebrating the warrior goddess.[47] From the
                medieval
                era up to present-day, Durga Puja has been celebrated as a socio-cultural event, while maintaining the
                roots
                of religious worship.[48]

        <img src="images/full_Pariwaar.png" alt="family" height="200" width="300" align="left">
        <p>Durga is often depicted with her four children: Ganesha, Kartikeya (also known as Skanda or Murugan),
            Lakshmi,
            and Saraswati. Each of these deities has their own significance and attributes:

            Ganesha: The elephant-headed god of wisdom, knowledge, and new beginnings. He is widely revered as the
            remover
            of obstacles and the god of intellect and learning.

            Kartikeya: The god of war and victory, often depicted as a youthful warrior riding a peacock. He is
            considered
            the commander of the divine army and is associated with courage and strength.

            Lakshmi: The goddess of wealth, prosperity, and fortune. She is often depicted sitting or standing on a
            lotus
            flower and is associated with abundance and good luck.

            Saraswati: The goddess of knowledge, music, art, wisdom, and learning. She is usually depicted playing the
            veena (a musical instrument) and is associated with creativity and intellectual pursuits.

            Together, Durga and her children represent a harmonious balance of power, wisdom, prosperity, and
            creativity,
            embodying the multifaceted nature of the divine feminine in Hinduism.</p>

        <img src="images/durgapho.png" alt="durga" height="150" width="200" align="right">
        <p>Maa Durga is one of the most revered and powerful goddesses in Hinduism, symbolizing strength, courage, and
            protection. She is often depicted riding a lion or tiger, holding various weapons in her multiple hands,
            each representing the power to destroy evil and restore righteousness. Maa Durga embodies the divine
            feminine energy, known as Shakti, and is worshipped for her ability to remove obstacles and bring peace,
            prosperity, and well-being to her devotees. Celebrated especially during the festival of Durga Puja, she is
            honored for her victory over the buffalo demon Mahishasura, signifying the triumph of good over evil. Her
            presence inspires devotion, courage, and moral strength in the hearts of her followers.</p>

        <h2>how maa durga was formed ?</h2>
        <img src="images/creation.png" alt="creation" height="300" width="280" align="left">
        <p>Maa Durga, one of the most powerful and revered goddesses in Hindu mythology, was formed through the combined
            energies of all the gods to defeat the mighty demon Mahishasura. Mahishasura, a demon with the ability to
            change forms, had performed severe penance and received a boon from Lord Brahma that made him almost
            invincible: no man or god could defeat him. Empowered by this boon, he began a reign of terror over the
            heavens and the earth, causing fear and destruction among humans, gods, and celestial beings alike. Unable
            to stop him individually, the gods decided to pool their divine powers into a single, formidable entity.

            From this collective energy emerged Maa Durga, a goddess of unparalleled strength, beauty, and courage. She
            was endowed with divine weapons and powers from each god: Lord Shiva gave her the trident, Lord Vishnu
            provided the discus, Lord Indra contributed his thunderbolt, Lord Varuna gave a conch, and many other gods
            supplied their celestial weapons. These gifts made her invincible and symbolized the unity of divine forces
            against evil. Maa Durga also rode a ferocious lion, representing her fearless nature and mastery over power
            and courage.

            Maa Durga‚Äôs formation is not just a story of battle but a symbolic representation of the triumph of good
            over evil and the protective, nurturing, yet fierce nature of the divine feminine energy, known as Shakti.
            Her creation reminds devotees that when darkness and injustice grow overwhelming, the combined forces of
            righteousness, wisdom, and courage can restore balance and harmony. Today, Maa Durga‚Äôs presence is
            celebrated through the festival of Durga Puja, where her story of formation, valor, and victory over
            Mahishasura inspires millions to embrace strength, morality, and devotion in their lives.</p>

    <div id="victory">

        <h2>how Maa Durga defeated Mahishashur?</h2>
        <img src="images/victory.png" alt="victory" height="300" width="280" align="left">
        <p>The story of Maa Durga‚Äôs victory over Mahishasur is a powerful tale of good triumphing over evil, celebrated
            with great devotion during Navratri and Durga Puja. Mahishasur, the mighty demon king, performed intense
            penance and was granted a boon by Lord Brahma that no man or god could kill him. Filled with arrogance, he
            began waging war against both heaven and earth, spreading fear everywhere. Even the gods were helpless
            before his invincible power, for none of them could destroy him.

            To restore balance in the universe, the supreme energies of all the gods merged together to create a divine
            warrior goddess‚ÄîMaa Durga. She appeared in a radiant form, mounted on a roaring lion, carrying powerful
            weapons given to her by different deities: Lord Shiva gave her the trident, Lord Vishnu the discus, Lord
            Varuna the conch, Lord Agni a spear, and many others contributed their strength. Maa Durga‚Äôs presence shone
            with unmatched energy, for she was the embodiment of Shakti, the divine feminine power.

            The battle between Maa Durga and Mahishasur raged for nine long days, symbolizing the nine forms of the
            goddess worshipped during Navratri. Mahishasur, gifted with the ability to change forms, kept
            transforming‚Äîfrom a buffalo to a lion, then an elephant, and even a human warrior. Yet every time, Maa Durga
            confronted him with unmatched valor and destroyed his illusions. On the tenth day, when Mahishasur once
            again took his terrifying buffalo form, Maa Durga struck him down with her trident, piercing through his
            chest and ending his reign of terror.

            This epic victory is remembered as Vijaya Dashami or Dussehra, symbolizing the triumph of righteousness over
            wickedness. The tale of Maa Durga defeating Mahishasur serves as a timeless reminder of courage, justice,
            and the supreme power of the divine feminine.</p>

        <h2>starting of durga puja</h2>
        <img src="images/start.png" alt="starting of durga puja" height="300" width="280" align="right">
        <p>Durga Puja, Bengal‚Äôs most celebrated festival, has its origins deeply entwined with both ancient mythology
            and historic social transformations. The worship of Goddess Durga can be traced back to Vedic times and
            became especially prominent in Bengal during the medieval period. Initially, Durga Puja was a private affair
            restricted mostly to wealthy zamindar families, who saw it as an occasion to display opulence and foster
            social bonds. Notable early celebrations include the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family's puja, which began in
            1610 at Barisha, and Nabakrishna Dev‚Äôs puja at Shobhabazar Rajbari in Kolkata in 1757.

            With the advent of British rule, new social classes emerged in Bengal‚Äîrich merchants and influential
            landowners used Durga Puja to affirm their status and connect with British officials and the local
            community. This competitive spirit pushed families to organize grand events, inviting dignitaries and
            showcasing luxurious idols dressed in gold and ornaments. However, as the 19th century approached, Durga
            Puja began to take on new significance, aligning itself with rising nationalist sentiments. The goddess was
            seen as an embodiment of the nation itself, and the festival became a rallying point for unity in the fight
            against colonial oppression.

            The twentieth century witnessed another key transformation: the rise of the ‚ÄúBarowari‚Äù or community puja,
            which shifted the celebration from exclusive family gatherings to public festivities where everyone could
            participate. The first communal Durga Puja in Kolkata was organized in 1910, marking the beginning of public
            celebrations that now define the festival. Today, Durga Puja in Bengal is not only a time for religious
            worship but also signifies social harmony, artistic vibrancy, and cultural pride, drawing people from all
            backgrounds to its spectacular pandals and joyous revelry</p>
