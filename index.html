        </p>
        <p>
            Durga Puja is one of the most important and grand festivals celebrated in India, especially in West Bengal,
            Assam, Odisha, Tripura, and Bangladesh. It is dedicated to Goddess Durga, who symbolizes strength, victory,
            and the destruction of evil. The festival usually takes place in the month of September or October, during
            the period of Sharad (autumn).

            According to mythology, Maa Durga fought and defeated the demon Mahishasura, who represented arrogance and
            evil. Thus, Durga Puja marks the triumph of good over evil. The festival begins with Mahalaya, which
            announces the arrival of the Goddess on Earth. The main celebrations continue for five days ‚Äî from Shashthi
            to Dashami.

            During these days, beautifully decorated pandals are built with artistic idols of Goddess Durga and her
            children ‚Äî Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartik, and Ganesha. People wear new clothes, offer prayers (Anjali), enjoy
            cultural programs, and taste delicious food. Traditional dances like Dhunuchi Naach, and rituals such as
            Sindoor Khela on Dashami, add to the festive charm.

            On the final day, Vijaya Dashami, the idols are immersed in rivers or ponds with the belief that Goddess
            Durga returns to her heavenly abode. People greet each other with sweets and wish for happiness and
            prosperity.

            Durga Puja is not just a religious occasion but also a cultural celebration that unites people, spreads joy,
            and highlights the spirit of togetherness. It is truly the heart and soul of Bengali culture and one of the
            greatest festivals of India.
